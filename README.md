Uses http://gridster.net/ and http://anthonyterrien.com/kontrol/

The idea is that you can add widgets of specific UI control elements and drag them
around to build a layout and save it. It should then allow you to send messages to Octoblu.

TODO:

- Use angular-gridster instead https://github.com/ManifestWebDesign/angular-gridster
- Need to create Add Widget button with menu to choose a UI element
- Add meshblu stuffs (sending messages, storing configuration in device property)

To use:

1. Press Build from Array
2. Drag around UI
3. Disable Dragging
4. Play with UI
5. ???
6. Profit
